Muscle Class Object Arduino Library



How to install this example into the Arduino IDE
================================================ 

1. The parent folder of this README file should be pasted into the ../Arduino/libraries 
	folder. 
2. Close all open Arduino IDE windows and restart the Arduino IDE. From the dropdown menu
	File>Examples>Examples From Custom Libraries>Muscle, open Muscle_Blink. 

If the example sketch opens, the Muscle class will now be available for your sketches. The 
example sketch explains how to use the various levels of functionality available in the class. 


Notes
=====

1. At the time of this writing, pressure-related functionality is limited at the hardware level. 
Because access to pressure sensors is included in the .h and .cpp files, it does not make sense 
to include example sketches that incorporate pressure-related class methods.   

2. keywords.txt specifies Muscle class variables for the purpose of enhanced text formatting in the 
Arduino IDE. This improved functionality is only available when the folder is pasted into the 
../Arduino/libraries folder, as indicated in the instructions above. 

Disclaimer
==========

This software package is specific to the Agile & Adaptive Robotics Laboratory
equipment at Portland State University and is written for deployment on Teensy 4.1 boards. Adjustments 
to the software may be needed for deployment elsewhere. Also, these instructions assume the 
software is to be used on the Arduino IDE. Adjustments may need to be made for use on other IDEs.

Muscle Class Object Arduino Library



How to install this example into the Arduino IDE
================================================ 

1. The folder containing this README file should be pasted into the ../Arduino/libraries 
	folder. 
2. Close all open Arduino IDE windows and restart the Arduino IDE. From the dropdown menu
	File>Examples>Examples From Custom Libraries>Muscle, open Muscle_Blink. 

If the example sketch opened, the Muscle class is now available for use in your sketches. The 
example sketch explains how to use the various levels of functionality available in the class. 


Notes
=====

At the time of this writing, pressure-related functionality is limited at the hardware level. Thus,
it does not make sense to write example sketches that incorporate the embedded pressure-related class
methods, although the hope is that it does.  


Disclaimer
==========

This software package is specific to the equipment at the Agile & Adaptive Robotics Laboratory 
at Portland State University and is written for deployment on Teensy 4.1 boards. Adjustments 
to the software may be needed for deployment elsewhere. Also, these instructions assume the 
software is to be used on the Arduino IDE. Adjustments may need to be made for use on other IDEs.
